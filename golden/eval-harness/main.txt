Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a sector of computer science focused on creating machines or software that can execute tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, perception, and language understanding. A subset of AI is Machine Learning, which employs algorithms and statistical models to allow computer systems to learn from data and enhance performance over time without explicit programming. It has various applications, including email filtering, network intruder detection, and computer vision. Machine learning can be divided into supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning based on the learning signal or feedback available. Another branch of AI is Natural Language Processing (NLP), which aims to facilitate interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP strives to read, decipher, understand, and interpret human language in a meaningful way.
